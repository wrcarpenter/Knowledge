Stay hungry, stay foolish. 

It gets easier, but it never gets easy. 

Mind over matter. 

Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

Cultivate an ever-continuous power of observation.

To work is to pray.

Make the best of an emergency. 

I would rather die of passion than of boredom.

There's no talent here. This is hard work. This is an obsession.

Losers focus on winners. Winners focus on winning.

We're not here to take part, we're here to take over.
